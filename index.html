      <h3> Indian Virtual Herbarium - A  National Informatics Centre Project </h3>
      <p>Assisted in designing and developing internal government web applications using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and PHP and Worked alongside experienced developers and IT officers, gaining valuable insight into e-Governance frameworks, data privacy policies, and system security best practices. The Indian Virtual Herbarium is a digital initiative developed at the National Informatics Centre (NIC) to provide a comprehensive, searchable online repository of India's plant biodiversity. The platform enables researchers, botanists, and the public to access high-resolution images and detailed information about thousands of preserved plant specimens collected from across the country.

As part of the project team, I contributed to enhancing user experience and optimizing data accessibility. This initiative supports conservation efforts, scientific research, and educational outreach by digitizing valuable herbarium records and making them freely accessible online.

      <h3> The Rage: A Short film</h3>
      <p>An emotional short film exploring grief and healing through symbolic storytelling and visual poetry. Shot and edited independently. This short film is a cinematic journey through emotions, memories, and moments that shape who we are. Set against contrasting backdropsâ€”both dark and vibrantâ€”it explores the silent battles we fight, the choices we regret, and the hope that often hides in plain sight. Without dialogue and visual storytelling at its core, the film invites you to feel more than just watch.</p>
